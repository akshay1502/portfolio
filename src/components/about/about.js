          I'm all about making cool stuff happen right in your browser. I like
          playing with CSS and diving deep into developer tools to see what
          magic I can create.

          Like keeping my code clean and tidyâ€”it's like making sure your room
          feels cozy and welcoming. Catching up with the latest trends and tech?
          Sure. I love knowing what's hot in the frontend world.

          When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me cracking up at funny
          videos, rooting for my CSK team, or chilling with Doraemon, my
          all-time favorite cartoon pal. And who doesn't love a good laugh with
          "Phir Hera Pheri," right? I'm always up for learning new stuff and
          hearing about how things work. And when I need to unwind, there's
          nothing like finding peace in the simple life of the village. Let's
          chat and swap stories!
